# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction-
This project implements a Heart Disease Risk Prediction system using Machine Learning algorithms to classify patients into High Risk or Low Risk categories based on health parameters. The model uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes classifiers and compares their performance using standard evaluation metrics.

#Objectives

-Predict the risk level of heart disease using patient health data
-Apply machine learning classification techniques
-Compare model performance using Accuracy, F1-Score and ROC-AUC
-Provide user input–based risk prediction

#Technologies Used

-Programming Language: Python
-Libraries:NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

#How to Run the Project

-Install required libraries:pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

-Run the program:python prediction.py
